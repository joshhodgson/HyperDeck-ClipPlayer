# HyperDeck ClipPlayer


This is an _extremely_ slapdash way of getting clips and playing them on a hyperdeck.

It gets the clip names and durations, and gives you a "go to" and a "play" control for each one. It sets the hyperdeck into "single clip" mode when it plays

_...i think, I didn't have a hyperdeck to hand when I wrote it._
